# Building a model for predicting apartment renting prices in Thu Duc District
### Project "Building a model for predicting apartment renting prices in Thu Duc District" is a research for building a model that can predict apartment renting prices in Thu Duc District. We aim to provide a tool or an approach that can estimate this price by examining important aspects such as size, number of bedrooms, floors, ward,...
- For conducting this project, we used Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebook, with the language Python and some frameworks such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy and sklearn. The approach and algorithm applied for this project was linear regression. We evaluated this model by using R-squared and K-fold cross-validation for selecting the best model.
- Our best result achieved from this project was a predicting model with all the known features above. User can import from 1 to 13 features, importing all these 13 features is not required. Model evaluation based on the dataset including missing data is 0.8133. This model is built by tuning and evaluating the results of 24 base model (13 one-feature models and 11 multi-feature models)
- The dataset is collected from [Nhatot](nhatot.com) restricted by the area of Thu Duc District, Ho Chi Minh City
